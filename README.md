## Python Project for Data Science

During this project, I assumed the position of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working on a real-world project.
I exhibited my skills in Python, the language of choice for data science and analysis.
I also used Python basics, data structures, and data manipulation in Python.
Finally, I created a dashboard in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Beautiful Soup, and Plotly.
