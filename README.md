## Python Project for Data Science

During this project, I assumed the position of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working on a real-world project.
I exhibited my skills in Python, the language of choice for data science and analysis.
Additionally, I employed fundamental concepts of Python programming, including data structures and data manipulation techniques. Ultimately, I have successfully developed a dashboard within a Jupyter Notebook utilizing the Python programming language and other libraries, including Pandas, Beautiful Soup, and Plotly.
